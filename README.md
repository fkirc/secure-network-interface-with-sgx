Trusted Network Interface

**Build Setup (Simulation Mode):**

This has been tested with Ubuntu 18.04.    
Please refer to the official Intel instructions if anything fails.

Install the packages:    
`make cmake git g++ cppcheck`    
`ocaml ocamlbuild automake autoconf libtool wget python libssl-dev`    
    
Download, build and install the linux-sgx sdk:    
`git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git`    
`cd linux-sgx`    
`./download_prebuilt.sh`    
`make sdk`    
`cd linux/installer/bin`    
`./build-installpkg.sh sdk`    
`./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_XXX.bin # install in "~" when asked`
    
Build and run the tests:

`./run_tests_locally.sh SIM`

**Build Setup (Hardware Mode):**

Please complete the simulation mode instructions before setting up the hardware mode.
Hardware mode works only on SGX-supported platforms.

Configure your system to `SGX enabled`. You might need to enable SGX within your BIOS settings.

Build and install the SGX Driver according to the instructions in
`https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver`.    
Afterwards, check whether the SGX Driver is running:
`lsmod | grep isgx`

Install the packages:    
`libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libcurl4-openssl-dev`

Build and install the SGX Platform Service:   
`cd linux-sgx`   
`make`   
`cd linux/installer/bin`   
`./build-installpkg.sh psw`   
`sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_psw_XXX.bin`   

Build and run the tests:

`git clean -xfd # cleanup for a fresh build`    
`./run_tests_locally.sh HW`

**Future work:**
Implementing those protocol validations in C is a bad idea with respect to security.
The choice of C was only made for the sake of a quick implementation.
I strongly recommend that future TEE implementations use a secure language from the beginning (e.g. Rust, Go, Java).

**Limitations of SGX:**
SGX cannot directly access any external hardware.
Therefore, it is necessary to establish a cryptographic channel to securely communicate between an SGX enclave and external hardware.
In this work, we used a "MACSec gateway" for this cryptographic channel.
Other TEEs can be configured to avoid this issue altogether (e.g. ARM TrustZone).
